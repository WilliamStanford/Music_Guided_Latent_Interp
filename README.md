# Music_Guided_Latent_Interp

This repository contains code and audio files my project "Music Guided Latent Interpolation," which was completed as part of my coursework for a Neural Rendering course taught at UNC - Chapel Hill by Soumyadip (Roni) Sengupta. 

I made use of a modified version of the Deforum Stable Diffusion google colab to generate images: https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum/stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb

Here are the current video results: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qLNIS4Z7Nc
